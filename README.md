# Astronaut Wrist Interface (AWI)

## Project Overview




## File Overview
There are three folders in the files. These folders are what store the checklists.txt files. The main fail that right now runs all the interface is the file named MainInterface.py. This file runs the entire GUI and implements the pyqt5 library. As the project moves on, specific functions like the direction finding system and the telemetry communication can be handled by other python files that will be called from the MainInterface.py file.  



## Resources
